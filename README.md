A simple app that uses MVC architecture to request API data and display it. 

The app loads the MainActivity fragment to output the images of the users,
and uses an onClickListener() interface to open a new Activity. 

The screenshots show the MainActivity and the ProfileActivity once the user has 
made a selection from MainActivity.
